This project leverages YOLOv8 to detect underwater objects in challenging visual environments such as low light and high noise conditions.

ðŸš€ Highlights:
Achieved 0.85 precision on test data using YOLOv8.

Trained, validated, and tested on Kaggle-sourced underwater datasets.

Applied extensive preprocessing and data augmentation to address real-world underwater challenges.

Performed hyperparameter tuning to boost localization and class prediction performance.

Implemented and executed in Google Colab for efficient GPU-based training.
